# Lab_4_Memory_and_Display_Controllers  
Project Overview:
Implement Ram Memory and display desired memory values on Nexys2 development board.  
This project consisted of implementing a sequential circuit that addresses all of the locations in a 256x16 RAM module. In this project, we display both the address inputs (to the RAM) and the data outputs (from the RAM) on the 7-segment displays on the Nexys2 development board.
  
Here is the schematic for this project:

Dependencies:  
This project was created using Xilinx ISE Project Navigator Version: 14.7.

Project Verification:  
The verification of this project was done using the Nexys2 development board and making sure that each address and data values appeared correctly on the 7-segment displays.
